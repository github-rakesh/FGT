                <h2>How Do All-Electric Cars Work?</h2>
                <img src="https://afdc.energy.gov/vite/assets/electric-DxcUKaFz.jpg" alt="Post Image" class="post-image">
                <p>All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank.</p>
